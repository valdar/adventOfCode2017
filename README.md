# adventOfCode2017
 This project contains my solutions of http://adventofcode.com/2017/.

 I hope to make it to the end this year and learning some Golang in the process.

## Try my solutions
Probably the easyest way to play with the code and try my solutions is to clone this repo in the right path under your `$GOPATH`:

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/valdar/
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/valdar/
git clone git@github.com:valdar/adventOfCode2017.git
```
